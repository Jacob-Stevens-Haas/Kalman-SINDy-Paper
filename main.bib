   abstract = {We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain. The regression framework relies on sparsity-promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models. The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis. Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework, where the sensors are fixed spatially , or in a Lagrangian framework, where the sensors move with the dynamics. The method is computationally efficient, robust, and demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation. Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially nonunique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data. Thus, for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation and the Korteweg-de Vries equation, for instance. The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parameterized spatiotemporal systems, where first-principles derivations are intractable.},

In this study, we extend SINDy to stochastic dynamical systems which are frequently used to model biophysical processes. We prove the asymptotic correctness of stochastic SINDy in the infinite data limit, both in the original and projected variables. We discuss algorithms to solve the sparse regression problem arising from the practical implementation of SINDy and show that cross validation is an essential tool to determine the right level of sparsity.

There has been rapid innovation in system identification across scientific domains, but there remains a gap in the literature for large-scale methodological comparisons that are evaluated on a variety of dynamical systems. In this work, we systematically benchmark sparse regression variants by utilizing the dysts standardized database of chaotic systems introduced by Gilpin [1]. In particular, we demonstrate how this open-source tool can be used to quantitatively compare different methods of system identification. To illustrate how this benchmark can be utilized, we perform a large comparison of four algorithms for solving the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) optimization problem, finding strong performance of the original algorithm and a recent mixed-integer discrete algorithm. In all cases, we used ensembling to improve the noise robustness of SINDy and provide statistical comparisons. In addition, we show very compelling evidence that the weak SINDy formulation provides significant improvements over the traditional method, even on clean data. Lastly, we investigate how Pareto-optimal models generated from SINDy algorithms depend on the properties of the equations, finding that the performance shows no significant dependence on a set of dynamical properties that quantify the amount of chaos, scale separation, degree of nonlinearity, and the syntactic complexity.},

However, it is challenging to characterize, much less guarantee, the global stability (i.e., long-time boundedness) of these models. Previous work provided a theorem outlining necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure global stability in systems with energy-preserving, quadratic nonlinearities, with the goal of evaluating the stability of projection-based models. In this work, we incorporate this theorem into modern data-driven models obtained via machine learning. First, we propose that this theorem should be a standard diagnostic for the stability of projection-based and data-driven models, examining the conditions under which it holds. Second, we illustrate how to modify the objective function in machine learning algorithms to promote globally stable models, with implications for the modeling of fluid and plasma flows. Specifically, we introduce a modified "trapping SINDy" algorithm based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method. This method enables the identification of models that, by construction, only produce bounded trajectories. The effectiveness and accuracy of this approach are demonstrated on a broad set of examples of varying model complexity and physical origin, including the vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder.},

Our method is based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework, where models are expressed as sparse linear combinations of pre-specified candidate functions. Promoting parsimony through sparsity leads to interpretable models that generalize to unknown data. Instead of targeting point estimates of the SINDy coefficients, we estimate these coefficients via sparse Bayesian inference. The resulting method, uncertainty quantification SINDy (UQ-SINDy), quantifies not only the uncertainty in the values of the SINDy coefficients due to observation errors and limited data, but also the probability of inclusion of each candidate function in the linear combination. UQ-SINDy promotes robustness against observation noise and limited data, interpretability (in terms of model selection and inclusion probabilities) and generalization capacity for out-of-sample forecast. Sparse inference for UQSINDy employs Markov chain Monte Carlo, and we explore two sparsifying priors: the spike and slab prior, and the regularized horseshoe prior. UQ-SINDy is shown to discover accurate models in the presence of noise and with orders-ofmagnitude less data than current model discovery methods, thus providing a transformative method for real-world applications which have limited data.},

However, even when the microscopic governing equations and qualitative macroscopic behaviour are known, it is often difficult to derive a stochastic model that is consistent with observations. This is especially true for systems such as turbulence where the perturbations do not behave like Gaussian white noise, introducing non-Markovian behaviour to the dynamics. We address these challenges with a framework for identifying interpretable stochastic nonlinear dynamics from experimental data, using forward and adjoint Fokker-Planck equations to enforce statistical consistency. If the form of the Langevin equation is unknown, a simple sparsifying procedure can provide an appropriate functional form. We demonstrate that this method can learn stochastic models in two artificial examples: recovering a nonlinear Langevin equation forced by coloured noise and approximating the second-order dynamics of a particle in a double-well potential with the corresponding first-order bifurcation normal form. Finally, we apply Langevin regression to experimental measurements of a turbulent bluff body wake and show that the statistical behaviour of the centre of pressure can be described by the dynamics of the corresponding laminar flow driven by nonlinear state-dependent noise.},

However, applying ML to problems in the physical sciences comes with a unique set of challenges: scientists want physically interpretable models that can (i) generalize to predict previously unobserved behaviors, (ii) provide effective forecasting predictions (extrapolation), and (iii) be certifiable. Autonomous systems will necessarily interact with changing and uncertain environments, motivating the need for models that can accurately extrapolate based on physical principles (e.g. Newton's universal second law for classical mechanics, F = ma). Standard ML approaches have shown impressive performance for predicting dynamics in an interpolatory regime, but the resulting models often lack interpretability and fail to generalize. We build on a sparse regression framework that discovers governing dynamical systems models from data, selecting relevant terms in the dynamics from a library of possible functions. Our critically enabling innovation introduces a relaxed version of a sparse optimization framework that allows the use of non-convex sparsity promoting regularization functions and addresses three open challenges in scientific problems and data sets: (i) robust handling of outliers and corrupt data within noisy sensor measurements, (ii) parametric dependencies in candidate library functions, and (iii) the imposition of physical constraints. By explicitly addressing these open challenges, the integrated and unified algorithm developed provides a significant advancement over current state-of-the-art sparse model discovery methods. We show that the approach discovers parsimonious dynamical models on several example systems. This flexible approach can be tailored to the unique challenges associated with a wide range of applications and data sets, providing a powerful ML-based framework for learning governing models for physical systems from data.},

   abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neurosci-ence, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing. dynamical systems | machine learning | sparse regression | system identification | optimization A dvances in machine learning (1) and data science (2) have promised a renaissance in the analysis and understanding of complex data, extracting patterns in vast multimodal data that are beyond the ability of humans to grasp. However, despite the rapid development of tools to understand static data based on statistical relationships, there has been slow progress in distilling physical models of dynamic processes from big data. This has limited the ability of data science models to extrapolate the dynamics beyond the attractor where they were sampled and constructed. An analogy may be drawn with the discoveries of Kepler and Newton. Kepler, equipped with the most extensive and accurate planetary data of the era, developed a data-driven model for planetary motion, resulting in his famous elliptic orbits. However, this was an attractor-based view of the world, and it did not explain the fundamental dynamic relationships that give rise to planetary orbits, or provide a model for how these bodies react when perturbed. Newton, in contrast, discovered a dynamic relationship between momentum and energy that described the underlying processes responsible for these elliptic orbits. This dynamic model may be generalized to predict behavior in regimes where no data were collected. Newton's model has proven remarkably robust for engineering design, making it possible to land a spacecraft on the moon, which would not have been possible using Kepler's model alone. A seminal breakthrough by Bongard and Lipson (3) and Schmidt and Lipson (4) has resulted in a new approach to determine the underlying structure of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. This method uses symbolic regression [i.e., genetic programming (5)] to find nonlinear differential equations, and it balances complexity of the model, measured in the number of terms, with model accuracy. The resulting model identification realizes a long-sought goal of the physics and engineering communities to discover dynamical systems from data. However, symbolic regression is expensive, does not scale well to large systems of interest, and may be prone to overfitting unless care is taken to explicitly balance model complexity with predictive power. In ref. 4, the Pareto front is used to find parsimonious models. There are other techniques that address various aspects of the dynamical system discovery problem. These include methods to discover governing equations from time-series data (6), equation-free modeling (7), empirical dynamic modeling (8, 9), modeling emergent behavior (10), and automated inference of dynamics (11-13); ref. 12 provides an excellent review. Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) In this work, we reenvision the dynamical system discovery problem from the perspective of sparse regression (14-16) and compressed sensing (17-22). In particular, we leverage the fact that most physical systems have only a few relevant terms that define the dynamics, making the governing equations sparse in a high-dimensional nonlinear function space. The combination of sparsity methods in dynamical systems is quite recent (23-30). Here, we consider dynamical systems (31) of the form d dt xðtÞ = fðxðtÞÞ. [1] The vector xðtÞ ∈ R n denotes the state of a system at time t, and the function fðxðtÞÞ represents the dynamic constraints that define the equations of motion of the system, such as Newton's second law. Later, the dynamics will be generalized to include parameterization, time dependence, and forcing. Significance Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in spar-sity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.},

Experimental data often has substantial amounts of measurement noise that compromises the ability to produce accurate dimen-sionality reduction, parameter estimation, reduced order models, and/or balanced models for control. Data assimilation attempts to overcome the deleterious effects of noise by producing a set of algorithms for state estimation from noisy and possibly incomplete measurements. Indeed, methods such as Kalman filtering and smoothing are vital tools for scientists in fields ranging from electronics to weather forecasting. In this work we develop a novel framework for smoothing data based on known or partially known nonlinear governing equations. The method yields superior results to current techniques when applied to problems with known deterministic dynamics. By exploiting the numerical time-stepping constraints of the deterministic system, an optimization formulation can readily extract the noise from the nonlinear dynamics in a principled manner. The superior performance is due in part to the fact that it optimizes global state estimates. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the method on a number of canonical examples, thus demonstrating its viability for the wide range of potential applications stated above.},

In this work, we leverage the statistical approach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of SINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The aggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of the candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and probabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to several synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate substantial improvements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely noisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential equations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as has been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra dynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected from 1900 to 1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as standard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be exploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.},

   abstract = {The striking fractal geometry of strange attractors underscores the generative nature of chaos: like probability distributions, chaotic systems can be repeatedly measured to produce arbitrarily-detailed information about the underlying attractor. Chaotic systems thus pose a unique challenge to modern statistical learning techniques, while retaining quantifiable mathematical properties that make them controllable and interpretable as benchmarks. Here, we present a growing database currently comprising 131 known chaotic dynamical systems spanning fields such as astrophysics , climatology, and biochemistry. Each system is paired with precomputed multivariate and univariate time series. Our dataset has comparable scale to existing static time series databases; however, our systems can be re-integrated to produce additional datasets of arbitrary length and granularity. Our dataset is annotated with known mathematical properties of each system, and we perform feature analysis to broadly categorize the diverse dynamics present across the collection. Chaotic systems inherently challenge forecasting models, and across extensive benchmarks we correlate forecasting performance with the degree of chaos present. We also exploit the unique generative properties of our dataset in several proof-of-concept experiments: surrogate transfer learning to improve time series classification, importance sampling to accelerate model training, and benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms.},
